The time.time() Function
The Unix epoch is a time reference commonly used in programming: 12 am
on January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The time.time()
            
function returns the number of seconds since that moment as a float value
               
(Recall that a float is just a number with a decimal point.) This number is 
           
called an epoch timestamp
